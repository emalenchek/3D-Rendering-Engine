# Requirements Specification & Test Plan

Status: **Active** — covers environment staging (Phase 0) and Phase 1 (terminal wireframe).
Later phases are outlined and will be specified in detail when their phase begins.
Derived from [docs/00-project-brief.md](00-project-brief.md) §4–5; verification methods follow
[docs/research/06-rust-testing-best-practices.md](research/06-rust-testing-best-practices.md).

## 1. Conventions

- **Requirement IDs** are stable: `FR-<phase>.<n>` (functional), `NFR-<n>` (non-functional).
- **Traceability**: every automated test embeds the lowercased requirement ID in its
  function name (`fn fr1_4_...`). `cargo test fr1_4` runs exactly that requirement's tests;
  grepping for `fr1_4` finds its coverage.
- **Verification methods**:
  - *Unit* — `#[cfg(test)]` tests, may touch private internals.
  - *Property* — `proptest` invariants over generated inputs.
  - *Golden frame* — render a fixed scene/camera/size, snapshot the character frame with `insta`.
  - *E2E* — run the real `tte` binary via `assert_cmd`; golden frames flow through the
    `--headless` frame-dump mode (no PTY needed).
  - *PTY* — interactive-path tests via a pseudo-terminal (`expectrl`); used sparingly, Phase 3+.
- A requirement is **Done** only when its mapped tests exist and pass in CI.

## 2. Phase 0 — Environment staging (implemented)

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-0.1 | `tte --version` prints `tte <semver>` and exits 0 |
| FR-0.2 | `tte --help` (and bare `tte`) prints usage and exits 0 |
| FR-0.3 | Unknown arguments exit non-zero with an error naming the argument and pointing to `--help` |

## 3. Phase 1 — Terminal wireframe renderer

**Deliverable:** `tte view model.obj` shows the model spinning as a wireframe in the
terminal; `tte view --headless --size WxH --frames N model.obj` dumps frames as plain text.

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-1.1 | Math types `Vec3`/`Vec4`/`Mat4` with multiply, `look_at`, and `perspective`; correct by the invariants in the test plan |
| FR-1.2 | OBJ loader for the minimal subset: `v`/`vt`/`vn`/`f` records; 1-based and negative indices; fan triangulation of >3-gon faces; unknown line types ignored; missing normals derived |
| FR-1.3 | Projection pipeline: model→view→projection transform of mesh edges, near-plane culling of edges crossing the near plane, perspective divide, viewport transform folding in the terminal cell aspect ratio |
| FR-1.4 | Bresenham line rasterization of projected edges into a cell buffer of configurable size |
| FR-1.5 | Cell buffer is a pure value with a deterministic plain-text rendering (one line per row), independent of any terminal |
| FR-1.6 | Terminal presenter: alternate screen on entry/exit, cursor hidden, cursor-home (not clear) between frames, one buffered write + flush per frame |
| FR-1.7 | Animation loop: model rotates at a fixed angular velocity on a fixed timestep; `q`/Ctrl-C exits cleanly restoring the terminal |
| FR-1.8 | Headless mode: `--headless --size WxH --frames N` renders N frames to stdout as plain text with no ANSI escapes, deterministically |

### Non-functional requirements

| ID | Requirement | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | Determinism: identical inputs (model, camera, size, frame index) produce byte-identical frames | Golden frame tests are themselves the check; double-render equality test |
| NFR-2 | Portability: workspace builds and tests pass on Linux, macOS, Windows | CI matrix |
| NFR-3 | Performance: headless render of a ≤1k-triangle model at 200×50 in ≤5 ms/frame on CI hardware (generous bound; terminal I/O excluded) | criterion bench, trend-tracked (not a hard CI gate) |
| NFR-4 | Code health: rustfmt-clean, clippy-clean (`-D warnings` in CI), no `unsafe` without justification | CI lint gate + workspace lint config |
| NFR-5 | Dependency hygiene: no known advisories; licenses within the allow-list | `cargo deny` CI gate |

## 3a. Phase 2 — Solid shaded renderer

**Deliverable:** `tte view` renders models as solid, depth-correct, diffuse-shaded
surfaces (not just wireframes), selectable across output fidelities — from a
universal ASCII luminance ramp to truecolor half-block "pixels".

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-2.1 | `Rgb` color type (8-bit channels) with a perceptual `luminance()` and intensity scaling; `Material` carrying a base color |
| FR-2.2 | `Framebuffer`: width×height grid of (depth, `Rgb`) with a depth-tested `plot` — a fragment is written only if nearer than what's there (z-buffer; no triangle sorting) |
| FR-2.3 | Edge-function triangle rasterization: bounding-box scan, barycentric coverage (inclusive → gap-free for shared edges); back-face culling via signed area. (Exact single-coverage top-left rule deferred to Phase 5 hardening — harmless under a z-buffer.) |
| FR-2.4 | Depth interpolated across each triangle (1/w-linear) and used for the z-test, resolving visibility correctly for overlapping geometry |
| FR-2.5 | Diffuse (Lambert) shading from one directional light + ambient term, in two modes: **flat** (one normal per triangle) and **Gouraud** (per-vertex normals, intensity interpolated) |
| FR-2.6 | ASCII luminance-ramp presenter: `Framebuffer` → `CellBuffer` using the ramp `.,-~:;=!*#$@`; pure plain text (the universal fallback; keeps the headless/golden-frame path) |
| FR-2.7 | Truecolor presenter: `Framebuffer` → ANSI 24-bit string, one block glyph per cell, with SGR run-merging (don't re-emit unchanged color) and a reset at end |
| FR-2.8 | Half-block presenter: two vertical sub-pixels per cell via `▀` (fg=upper, bg=lower) — 2× vertical resolution at full per-sub-pixel color (research D4 high-fidelity default) |
| FR-2.9 | CLI: `tte view --render solid\|wireframe`, `--shading flat\|gouraud`, `--mode ascii\|truecolor\|halfblock`; headless output deterministic per mode |

### Non-functional (Phase 2 additions)

| ID | Requirement | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| NFR-6 | Truecolor/half-block output ends with an SGR reset (`\x1b[0m`) and emits no color code for a cell whose color equals the previous cell (byte-level run-merging) | presenter unit tests |
| NFR-3 (ext) | Solid shaded render of a ≤1k-triangle model at 200×50 stays within the ≤5 ms/frame bound | criterion bench |

## 3b. Phase 3 — Interactive orbit camera

**Deliverable:** `tte view` lets the user orbit the camera around the model in real
time — rotate with arrows / hjkl, zoom with +/−, toggle auto-orbit, reset — and the
view tracks terminal resizes. Headless gains `--yaw/--pitch/--radius` so any orbit view
is reproducible for tests.

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-3.1 | `OrbitCamera` in core: spherical state (yaw, pitch, radius, target) → eye position; produces a `Camera`. Pitch clamped to just under ±90°; radius clamped to a sane range. Pure/deterministic. |
| FR-3.2 | Orbit mutations: `orbit(dyaw, dpitch)` (pitch clamped) and `dolly(factor)` (radius clamped); eye is always exactly `radius` from `target`. |
| FR-3.3 | Headless orbit flags `--yaw DEG --pitch DEG --radius F` render a deterministic, reproducible view (golden-frame e2e). |
| FR-3.4 | Live resize: the interactive loop renders at the current terminal size every frame, so a resize shows on the next frame; size clamped to a usable minimum. |
| FR-3.5 | Interactive controls: arrows/hjkl orbit, +/=/i zoom in, −/o zoom out, space toggles auto-orbit, r resets, q/Esc/Ctrl-C quit. Key→action mapping is pure + unit-tested; the live loop is covered by a PTY smoke test. |

### The functional e2e shape (template for all phases)

Every phase's headline requirement gets at least one test of this exact shape — the
full real path with deterministic inputs and a reviewable golden frame:

```text
fixture scene (tests/data/) ──> real `tte` binary, --headless, fixed size/camera/frame
                                          │
                                          ▼
                          plain-text frame on stdout (no ANSI)
                                          │
                                          ▼
                     insta::assert_snapshot! ──> committed .snap golden file
```

## 5. Later phases (outline — to be specified at phase start)

- **Phase 3 (interactive orbit):** FR-3.x — raw mode, orbit camera, resize. PTY tests enter scope.
- **Phase 4 (scene DSL):** FR-4.x — KDL-grammar parser, named materials, mesh refs,
  diagnostics, hot reload. Property round-trips + `cargo-fuzz` on the parser; golden frames per scene fixture.
